# What has been updated?

## Changelog - (Added, Fixed, Removed):

1. Fixed an issue with Albedo (Body & Legs) coloring, when selecting a player with different color, it would display as bugged from the top to the bottom of the player skin.
  
2. Fixed an issue with create character prompt action, it would always be active even if it was not displayed on the prompts. It was just removing the prompt from being displayed and not also disable the action itself.

3. Fixed an issue with new player hairs, when a player was not selecting a hair (which is rare), they would become bold.

4. Fixed an issue with new female characters, they would spawn with beardstabble (men shaving style).

5. Fixed an issue with `reloadskin` command for new characters, it was not functional.
